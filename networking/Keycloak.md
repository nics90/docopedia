Running Keycloak in a highly available configuration on a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment can help ensure that your application remains available and accessible even if one or more clusters or regions become unavailable. Here are the general steps to achieve this:

1.  Set up a Kubernetes cluster in each region: You will need to set up a Kubernetes cluster in each region where you want to deploy Keycloak.
    
2.  Install and configure Keycloak on each cluster: Install Keycloak on each Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager or the Kubernetes manifests. Ensure that the Keycloak instances are configured with the same realm, user, and client configurations.
    
3.  Set up a load balancer for Keycloak: Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic across the Keycloak instances in each region. This load balancer can be set up using Kubernetes services or an external load balancer.
    
4.  Configure Keycloak instances to use the same database: To ensure that all Keycloak instances have access to the same user, client, and realm data, configure them to use the same database.
    
5.  Set up cross-region network communication: Set up cross-region network communication between the Kubernetes clusters so that the Keycloak instances in each region can communicate with each other.
6. Configure Keycloak for cross-region communication: Configure the Keycloak instances to use a common shared secret for inter-cluster communication, and configure the instances to use the same hostname and port for intra-cluster communication.
    
7.  Enable session replication: Enable session replication in Keycloak to ensure that user sessions are synchronized across all Keycloak instances.
    
8.  Test the deployment: Finally, test the deployment to ensure that it is functioning correctly. Test the failover by simulating the failure of one or more Keycloak instances or regions.
    

Note that there may be additional steps or configurations required based on your specific Kubernetes setup and environment. It is important to carefully plan and test the deployment to ensure that it meets your availability and performance requirements.
